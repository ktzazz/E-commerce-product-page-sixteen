## My process

This project has been by far the most difficult one, there were many things on js that I didn't know how to code, I had to do lots of research and it took my a good amount of days to finish the challenge but I did it and I'm proud of my growth. I learn many new things like, concepts, methods, different ways to do cleaner and more efficient code.
